# having fun building a tic tac toe

## Why

Friday morning, C lab, I've already finished the work of all the labs, and the
last exercise asked to build a tic-tac-toe.

I am interest in learning Reinforcement Learning techniques so I was like, yeah
let's build a RL algo to learn how to beat this game.

So I started reading the [Sutton & Barto's book](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf)
but my professor suggested me to start with the minimax algo, because RL is
overkill for the ttt.

So I am just going to use different techniques to solve this problem. I am just
trying to learn stuff.
